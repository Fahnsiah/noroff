    <h1>We are working with Topograph</h1>

    <p>
      This is an example of using typography in CSS to style text elements on a
      webpage. We can control font size, color, style, and other properties to
      create visually appealing content.

      "Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written
      language readable and appealing."
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example, we've used
      <span class="highlight">CSS selectors</span> to apply different styles to
      specific elements.
